# GitHub Pages Redirect

This repository hosts the GitHub Pages site for [themarcellvarga.github.io](https://themarcellvarga.github.io), which automatically redirects visitors to my main website at [marcellvarga.com](https://marcellvarga.com).

## Purpose

The sole purpose of this repository is to handle redirects from the default GitHub Pages domain to my personal domain. This ensures that anyone trying to access my GitHub Pages site is seamlessly redirected to my main website.

## Implementation

The redirect is implemented using a simple HTML meta refresh in the index.html file. This method was chosen for its reliability and compatibility across browsers.
